% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.

% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
\usepackage[accepted]{icml2019}

% The \icmltitle you define below is probably too long as a header.

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

\subsection{Deepfakes}

Deepfake는 어떤 것을 말한다. (대충 인터넷에 많고 사생활 침해도 우려된다는 내용). Deepfake를 생성하는 대표적인 방법은 generative adversarial networ (GAN)을 이용하는 방법이다.

따라서 이번 프로젝트에서 Deep

\section{Datasets}

We will use Deepfake Detection Dataset by Google \& Jigsaw \cite{DDD_GoogleJigSaw2019} which is available on GitHub page of FaceForensics++ \cite{roessler2019faceforensicspp}.

Google에서 공개한 Deepfake Detection Dataset \cite{DDD_GoogleJigSaw2019} 을 사용할 예정이다. 해당 dataset은 FaceForensics++ \cite{roessler2019faceforensicspp}의 GitHub 
페이지에서 내려받을 수 있다.

\section{Goals}

우리의 목표는 이다.

\section{Brief Schedule}

\section{Roles}

우리 팀은 총 5명으로 이루어져 있다. 모든 팀원이 모델 기획 및 구현에 참여하며, 기타 여러 가지 업무를 다음과 같이 분담하여 진행하기로 하였다.
\begin{itemize}
	\item 제한재 -- Data preprocessing
	\item 도재형, 홍주연 -- SOTA model \& dataset research
	\item 채병주, 허환 -- Model fine-tuning
\end{itemize}
